# Bitmap-Project
This is my course project for my Computer Architecture Class. 
My project has an earth day theme and shows 2 graphs based on user input from the keyboard. 
The first graph shows hydropower usage in the world, and the second graph shows solar power. 
You can switch between the two graphs using the left and right keys (a and d).
